          <p>Maui is a two-year-old mini-doodle who thinks he is as big as a German shepherd. This mindset allows him to voice his opinion, especially when demanding food or attention. He is also a classic momma's boy, as he has learned if he is annoying enough, he can get anything he demands. </p>
          <p>During his lounging time, he gets to the highest chair he can get on and stares outside, waiting either for guests or belly rubs. He also has the tendency to force his mother to go to sleep as soon as his father goes to bed.</p>

          <p>Jojo is a 14-year-old dog that has grown up with me. He's a Lhasa-Apso, a breed from Tibet known to be a watchdog. Funny enough, Jojo acts exactly like a watchdog. He likes to spend his days sitting next to a window looking and barking at people passing by. He is only a watchdog, though, as he gets scared very easily.</p>
          <p>His favorite thing in life is food, and his favorite foods are sweet potatoes and naan. He loves walks as well; however, he will not go outside if it's raining or if there's a lot of snow on the ground. He's also trilingual, able to understand English, Hindi, and Japanese.</p>

          <p>Sofie is a 15-year-old Beagle mix. Her favorite spot in the house is the living room couch. She loves to go outside, sometimes too much, leaving us to open the door for her constantly. Sofie loves freshly cut grass; she rolls around in it for hours after it gets cut.</p>
          <p>Sofie is very old; she joined our family when I was still in a car seat. Sofie loves the weekends because she gets her favorite treat, a fried egg. Sofie loves long walks around the lake or on the trail, where she can be let free to run to her heart's content.</p>

          <p>Zack's favorite foods are unsalted sunflower seeds and mangos. He loves being able to sit on people's shoulder and talking to them. Zack knows over 500 words and learns more every day.</p>
